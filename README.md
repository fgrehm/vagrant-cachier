# vagrant-cachier

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/vagrant-cachier.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/vagrant-cachier) [![Gittip](http://img.shields.io/gittip/fgrehm.svg)](https://www.gittip.com/fgrehm/)

A [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) plugin that helps you reduce the amount of
coffee you drink while waiting for boxes to be provisioned by sharing a common
package cache among similiar VM instances. Kinda like [vagrant-apt_cache](https://github.com/avit/vagrant-apt_cache)
or [this magical snippet](http://gist.github.com/juanje/3797297) but targetting
multiple package managers and Linux distros.


## Installation

Make sure you have Vagrant 1.4+ and run:

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier
```

## Quick start

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = 'your-box'
  if Vagrant.has_plugin?("vagrant-cachier")
    # Configure cached packages to be shared between instances of the same base box.
    # More info on http://fgrehm.viewdocs.io/vagrant-cachier/usage
    config.cache.scope = :box

    # If you are using VirtualBox, you might want to use that to enable NFS for
    # shared folders. This is also very useful for vagrant-libvirt if you want
    # bi-directional sync
    config.cache.synced_folder_opts = {
      type: :nfs,
      # The nolock option can be useful for an NFSv3 client that wants to avoid the
      # NLM sideband protocol. Without this option, apt-get might hang if it tries
      # to lock files needed for /var/cache/* operations. All of this can be avoided
      # by using NFSv4 everywhere. Please note that the tcp option is not the default.
      mount_options: ['rw', 'vers=3', 'tcp', 'nolock']
    }
    # For more information please check http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/basic_usage.html
  end
end
```
